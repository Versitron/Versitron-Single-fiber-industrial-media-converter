# Versitron Single Fiber Industrial Media Converter

The **Versitron Single Fiber Industrial Media Converter** is engineered for harsh environments where space, performance, and reliability are critical. Designed to transmit and receive data over a single optical fiber strand using WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) technology, this unit is ideal for remote, space-limited, or cost-sensitive industrial networks.

## Product Overview

This rugged media converter allows Ethernet data to travel over a single fiber while maintaining full-duplex communication. It’s perfect for industrial automation, SCADA systems, transportation infrastructure, and energy monitoring applications that require hardened equipment with long-distance optical performance.

## Key Features

- **Single Fiber Operation (WDM)**: Transmit and receive data over one fiber using different wavelengths (e.g., 1310nm/1550nm).
- **Industrial Hardened Design**: Withstands extreme temperatures, vibrations, and electrical interference.
- **Wide Temperature Range**: Operates in environments from -40°C to 75°C.
- **DIN-Rail Mountable**: Easy integration into control panels and industrial enclosures.
- **Plug-and-Play Simplicity**: No software setup required—connect and go.
- **LED Indicators**: Real-time diagnostics for power, link status, and activity.

## Typical Applications

- **Factory Automation**: Connect PLCs, sensors, and control systems over fiber in manufacturing environments.
- **Oil & Gas**: Maintain stable, interference-free communication across well sites and refineries.
- **Traffic Systems**: Link cameras and control devices across highways or intersections using a single fiber.
- **Smart Grid**: Transmit monitoring data across substations and renewable energy sites.
